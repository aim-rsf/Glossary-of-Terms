# About the AIM Projects 

> Introduction section 


## OPTIMAL 

> The OPTIMAL project is based at the University of Birmingham and University of Manchester, with collaborators in the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde, and the University of St Andrews
> The project is about **OPTIM**ising therapies, discovering therapeutic targets and **AI** assisted clinical management for patients **L**iving with complex multiple long-term conditions. This description is how the team came up with the name **OPTIMAL**.

### What’s the problem OPTIMAL is addressing?
We treat each disease separately. This means we prescribe a different drug for each condition, which may not help people with four or more long-term health problems. (We say these people have complex multimorbidity or "**cMM**".) A drug for one disease can make another disease worse or better. But there’s no information on the effect of one drug on a second disease. This means we are not sure which drug to prescribe in these people.
We can group such people based on their mixes of disease. Then we can study the effects of a drug on each disease mix. This should help doctors prescribe better and reduce the number of drugs patients need. That would benefit almost all people with cMM.

### The OPTIMAL project aims to
* Find the mix of diseases and drug treatments that interact over time to worsen or improve a patient’s health.
* Predict the next disease that people might develop.
* Find drugs that help more than one disease.
* With input from lay people and health professionals, produce computer programs to help doctors improve the choice of drugs in patients with cMM.

### How will OTIPMAL do this?
1.	Link large, detailed health records of patients who attend GP services and hospitals that have been collected since 1999. These include all diagnoses, disease severity, drugs, blood tests, readings such as blood pressure, scans, and specialist tests. Using artificial intelligence (AI) methods, model how the different mixes of diseases arise over time. The models will tell us what drugs cause or prevent a new disease. This will show if a drug helps improve symptoms of a disease or make them worse. The model will also help predict who may get another disease.
2.	Ask lay people and doctors about their knowledge and views of AI guided clinical choice making. This will help us make these models better to use in practice.
3.	Use AI computer techniques to combine data, and together with the input from lay people and doctors, develop a computer program. This will predict which drug we should give and when we should give it to someone with cMM to reduce the risk of harm and bring about maximum benefit. It will also tell us what disease people may get next.
4.	Examine the best way to present information in the computer program to lay people and doctors by asking them about what is important to them and what options they prefer.

The OPTIMAL team includes patients, public members, and world leading experts from three universities with expertise in biology, AI, medicine, health service research, public health, and general practice. All will improve the care of people with cMM. We will make all outputs including software and data models openly available.

## MELD-B

> The MELD-B project is based at the University of Southampton, with collaborators at University of Glasgow, Swansea University, Southampton City Council, the University of Aberdeen, and King's College London
> The MELD-B team uses an Artificial Intelligence-enhanced analysis of birth cohort data and electronic health records to identify lifecourse time points and targets for the prevention of early-onset, burdensome Multiple Long-Term Conditions. 

### Background to MELD-B's Research
A growing number of people are living with several long-term health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, depression or dementia. We call this multimorbidity. Many things throughout a person’s life influence the chances of developing health conditions. This includes their biology (e.g. age, ethnicity), things that happen to them (e.g. infections, accidents), behaviours (e.g. smoking, diet) and broader experiences (e.g. the environment people grew up in, their education, work, income). People from more disadvantaged backgrounds and/or certain ethnicities are more likely to develop multimorbidity and to develop it   earlier. The impact (or ‘burden’) of multimorbidity, and the order that people develop conditions, also vary. We don’t know what all the possible opportunities are to prevent burdensome multi-morbidity. 

### MELD-B's Research Aims
We aim to understand more about what things influence the way people develop early multimorbidity over their lifetime and the burden this has for them. By ‘early’ we mean before age 65. This will identify key time points in a person’s life where prevention efforts should be targeted or strengthened to reduce the risk of that person developing burdensome multimorbidity. 

### The Research Design and methods used
1.	To understand what ‘burdensome’ means for people with multimorbidity and how it   could be prevented or reduced, we will ask patients, carers and multimorbidity experts their views and carefully summarise previous research on this issue.
2.	Ideally, we would study very large numbers of people from birth to death. However, not enough of this type of data is available. Therefore, we will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods (using computers to learn patterns from data) to help us connect information and knowledge from two very big General Practitioner datasets with information from three ‘birth cohorts’ – research studies of people all born in    the same year (e.g. 1970) and followed throughout their lives. 
3.	We will also use AI methods to help us understand the order in which people develop conditions and how they group together to become ‘burdensome’. 
4.	We will have experts and members of the public in a ‘People, Policy and Impact’ group identify opportunities to prevent burdensome multimorbidity. 

## How MELD-B will involve patients and memebrs of the public
A diverse ten-person Patient and Public Advisory Board will oversee the project. Members of the Board will actively engage with each element of the project and be asked to discuss results as they emerge. This will ensure that the experiences and priorities of people living with multimorbidity will always be considered.  Their input will ensure all decisions consider the experiences and priorities of people with multimorbidity. 

## How MELD-B's will share their research's findings
Our ‘People, Policy and Impact’ group will share our learning and influence policy and practice on preventing burdensome multimorbidity by co-producing public health advice.  We will share findings through academic channels, a website and social media.
