Clinical Phenotypes
	A single or combination of observable disease attributes that describe differences (such as symptoms, exacerbations, response to therapy, rate of disease progression) between individuals with a disease or condition {cite}`Augusti2013`. Clincal Phenotypes can be used by researchers as inclusion and exclusion measures for different illnesses and conditions that they are researching.

        The co-occurrence of three or more chronic conditions affecting three or more different body systems within one person without defining an index chronic condition. {cite}`Harrisone004694`

Epidemiology 	
	The study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why. Epidemiological information is used to plan and evaluate strategies to prevent illness and as a guide to the management of patients in whom disease has already developed {cite}`coggon1997`.

Multiple Long-Term Conditions (MLTC)
	The term ‘multiple long-term conditions’ (MLTC) refers to the co-existence of two or more chronic conditions (physical or mental) in a person. In medical and research circles, this has often been referred to as 'multimorbidity'. The term MLTC is used more widely by patient groups and researchers as it is better understood and preferred by patients, carers and the public {cite}`NIHR-MLTC2022`.

Population Data Science
