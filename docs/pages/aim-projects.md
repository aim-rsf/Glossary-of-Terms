## OPTIMAL 

### What’s the problem?
We treat each disease separately. This means we prescribe a different drug for each condition, which may not help people with four or more long-term health problems. (We say these people have complex multimorbidity or "**cMM**".) A drug for one disease can make another disease worse or better. But there’s no information on the effect of one drug on a second disease. This means we are not sure which drug to prescribe in these people.
We can group such people based on their mixes of disease. Then we can study the effects of a drug on each disease mix. This should help doctors prescribe better and reduce the number of drugs patients need. That would benefit almost all people with cMM.

### The OPTIMAL project aims to:
•	Find the mix of diseases and drug treatments that interact over time to worsen or improve a patient’s health.
•	Predict the next disease that people might develop.
•	Find drugs that help more than one disease.
•	With input from lay people and health professionals, produce computer programs to help doctors improve the choice of drugs in patients with cMM.

### How will we do this?
1.	Link large, detailed health records of patients who attend GP services and hospitals that have been collected since 1999. These include all diagnoses, disease severity, drugs, blood tests, readings such as blood pressure, scans, and specialist tests. Using artificial intelligence (AI) methods, model how the different mixes of diseases arise over time. The models will tell us what drugs cause or prevent a new disease. This will show if a drug helps improve symptoms of a disease or make them worse. The model will also help predict who may get another disease.
2.	Ask lay people and doctors about their knowledge and views of AI guided clinical choice making. This will help us make these models better to use in practice.
3.	Use AI computer techniques to combine data, and together with the input from lay people and doctors, develop a computer program. This will predict which drug we should give and when we should give it to someone with cMM to reduce the risk of harm and bring about maximum benefit. It will also tell us what disease people may get next.
4.	Examine the best way to present information in the computer program to lay people and doctors by asking them about what is important to them and what options they prefer.

Our team includes patients, public members, and world leading experts from three universities with expertise in biology, AI, medicine, health service research, public health, and general practice. All will improve the care of people with cMM. We will make all outputs including software and data models openly available.
