## OPTIMAL 

> The OPTIMAL project is based at the University of Birmingham and University of Manchester, with collaborators in the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde, and the University of St Andrews </br>
> 
> The project is about **OPTIM**ising therapies, discovering therapeutic targets and **AI** assisted clinical management for patients **L**iving with complex multiple long-term conditions. This description is how the team came up with the name **OPTIMAL**.

### What's the research problem OPTIMAL is addressing?
We treat each disease separately. This means we prescribe a different drug for each condition, which may not help people with four or more long-term health problems. (We say these people have complex multimorbidity or "**cMM**".) A drug for one disease can make another disease worse or better. But there’s no information on the effect of one drug on a second disease. This means we are not sure which drug to prescribe in these people.
We can group such people based on their mixes of disease. Then we can study the effects of a drug on each disease mix. This should help doctors prescribe better and reduce the number of drugs patients need. That would benefit almost all people with cMM.

### The OPTIMAL project aims to
* Find the mix of diseases and drug treatments that interact over time to worsen or improve a patient’s health.
* Predict the next disease that people might develop.
* Find drugs that help more than one disease.
* With input from lay people and health professionals, produce computer programs to help doctors improve the choice of drugs in patients with cMM.

### How will OTIPMAL do this?
1.	Link large, detailed health records of patients who attend GP services and hospitals that have been collected since 1999. These include all diagnoses, disease severity, drugs, blood tests, readings such as blood pressure, scans, and specialist tests. Using artificial intelligence (AI) methods, model how the different mixes of diseases arise over time. The models will tell us what drugs cause or prevent a new disease. This will show if a drug helps improve symptoms of a disease or make them worse. The model will also help predict who may get another disease.
2.	Ask lay people and doctors about their knowledge and views of AI-guided clinical choice making. This will help us make these models better to use in practice.
3.	Use AI computer techniques to combine data, and together with the input from lay people and doctors, develop a computer program. This will predict which drug we should give and when we should give it to someone with cMM to reduce the risk of harm and bring about maximum benefit. It will also tell us what disease people may get next.
4.	Examine the best way to present information in the computer program to lay people and doctors by asking them about what is important to them and what options they prefer.

The OPTIMAL team includes patients, public members, and world leading experts from three universities with expertise in biology, AI, medicine, health service research, public health, and general practice. All will improve the care of people with cMM. We will make all outputs including software and data models openly available.

## MELD-B

> The MELD-B project is based at the University of Southampton, with collaborators at University of Glasgow, Swansea University, Southampton City Council, the University of Aberdeen, and King's College London. </br>
> 
> The MELD-B team uses an Artificial Intelligence-enhanced analysis of birth cohort data and electronic health records to identify lifecourse time points and targets for the prevention of early-onset, burdensome Multiple Long-Term Conditions. 

### Background to MELD-B's Research
A growing number of people are living with several long-term health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, depression or dementia. We call this Multiple Long-Term Conditions, which can be shortened to MLTC or "multimorbidity". Many things throughout a person’s life influence the chances of developing health conditions. This includes their biology (e.g. age, ethnicity), things that happen to them (e.g. infections, accidents), behaviours (e.g. smoking, diet) and broader experiences (e.g. the environment people grew up in, their education, work, income). People from more disadvantaged backgrounds and/or certain ethnicities are more likely to develop MLTC and to develop it earlier. The impact (or ‘burden’) of MLTC, and the order that people develop conditions, also varies. We don’t know what all the possible opportunities are to prevent burdensome MLTC. 

### MELD-B's Research Aims
We aim to understand more about what things influence the way people develop early MLTC over their lifetime and the burden this has for them. By ‘early’ we mean before age 65. This will identify key time points in a person’s life where prevention efforts should be targeted or strengthened to reduce the risk of that person developing burdensome MLTC. 

### The Research Design and methods used
1.	To understand what ‘burdensome’ means for people with MLTC and how it could be prevented or reduced, we will ask patients, carers and MLTC experts their views and carefully summarise previous research on this issue.
2.	Ideally, we would study very large numbers of people from birth to death. However, not enough of this type of data is available. Therefore, we will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods (using computers to learn patterns from data) to help us connect information and knowledge from two very big General Practitioner datasets with information from three ‘birth cohorts’ – research studies of people all born in the same year (e.g. 1970) and followed throughout their lives. 
3.	We will also use AI methods to help us understand the order in which people develop conditions and how they group together to become ‘burdensome’. 
4.	We will have experts and members of the public in a ‘People, Policy and Impact’ group identify opportunities to prevent burdensome MLTC. 

### How MELD-B will involve patients and memebrs of the public
A diverse ten-person Patient and Public Advisory Board will oversee the project. Members of the Board will actively engage with each element of the project and be asked to discuss results as they emerge. This will ensure that the experiences and priorities of people living with MLTC will always be considered. Their input will ensure all decisions consider the experiences and priorities of people with MLTC. 

### How MELD-B's will share their research's findings
Our ‘People, Policy and Impact’ group will share our learning and influence policy and practice on preventing burdensome MLTC by co-producing public health advice. We will share findings through academic channels, a website and social media.

## AIM-CISC
> The AIM-CISC team will use Artificial Intelligence to analyse and understand this information to attempt to establish what patterns of Multiple Long-Term Conditions (sometimes called "multimorbidity") are most common, which most affect people's lives, and help improve quality and safety of care

### Background to AIM-CISC's Project
Long-term conditions are health issues which persist over years. Many people have more than one long-term condition (e.g. having both diabetes and asthma), which is usually referred to as having Multiple Long-Term Conditions, or "multimorbidity". Multimorbidity often seriously affects how well people feel and what they are able to do. 

However, health professionals like doctors or nurses often focus on one condition at a time. This can make it hard to ensure that care is properly joined-up and coordinated for people with Multiple Long-Term Conditions. Research also tends to focus on one condition at a time. This is partly because people with Multiple Long-Term Conditions, can have very complicated mixes of different conditions and treatments. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses powerful computers to analyse and understand this kind of complex information, which is carefully gathered by the NHS and others under strict rules to keep it safe and confidential. New AI methods can help us better understand what patterns of Multiple Long-Term Conditions are common and which most affect people’s lives, and help improve the quality and safety of care. 

### What AIM-CISC Aims to achieve 
We propose a programme of research which will use AI methods to:

1. Identify the most common combinations of long-term conditions that people have, and examine whether people inherit a tendency to get particular combinations of conditions from their parents. This will help us understand what causes Multiple Long-Term Conditions, and identify potential treatments.

2. Examine whether particular combinations of long-term conditions are more common in some areas or communities. This will help us understand how where people live affects their health (for example, through differences in air pollution, or in access to safe open-space to play/exercise, or in having local shops that sell affordable healthy food).

3. Develop new methods for identifying people who are likely to have unexpected health problems like falls or bleeding. This will help us to work out what changes to their treatment or care could prevent these problems. One example of a possible change is medicines review to make sure that people take the right medicines for them as an individual. Another is rapid, comprehensive assessment of people admitted to hospital to ensure that their care suits all of their needs rather than just the problem that brought them into hospital.

Our team combines expertise in AI methods with experience in delivering and researching healthcare for people with Multiple Long-Term Conditions. 
We will work closely with patients and members of the public to help us focus and interpret our research, and to help us make our findings widely known. 
We will also work closely with other research teams to share learning and methods, and with the NHS and government to ensure that the research turns into practical improvements in care.

### Background to the DECODE project

About 1 in 100 people are identified as having Intellectual Disabilities (also known as learning disability in UK). Of these, about two-thirds have two or more long-term health problems, known as Multiple Long-Term Conditions (MLTCs). Sometimes these conditions, such as diabetes and heart problems, can be delayed or prevented through lifestyle changes. For other conditions like epilepsy, better management can improve the quality of life.
We are a group of researchers, health care professionals, people with intellectual disabilities and carers. We are committed to valuing diversity and improving the lives of people with intellectual disabilities to manage and prevent MLTCs.


### Aims of the research

We will use computer programs, called machine learning, to learn more about MLTCs in people with intellectual disabilities. We will find out which conditions are more likely to occur together and what happens over time. This information will help us to develop a new way of providing the care for people with Intellectual disabilities and MLTCs which would be better co-ordinated, effective and timely.

### Design and methods used

Our research combines Healthcare Information (data) and what we hear from experts. The experts include Experts by Experience (people with intellectual disabilities and their carers) and Professional Experts.

1.	Healthcare information (data)
We will use healthcare data on people with intellectual disabilities from England and Wales to find out:
* MLTCs that tend to occur together, and
* What happens to some of these MLTCs over time and the because of factors such as people's lifestyle habits, and their financial and social situations.

2.	Input from Experts by Experience
People with intellectual disabilities, their families, and carers will either act as research partners (as part of Public and Patient Involvement groups) or as research participants. We will recruit research participants for workshops or interviews where this is needed. They will help to:
* Decide on the most important MLTCs affecting the lives of people with intellectual disabilities.
* Make recommendations about the care of people with MLTCs.
* Produce visual information such as graphs and infographics specially designed for people that will use them, including people with intellectual disabilities. When we have finished this work, we will propose a new model which aims to improve care and support for people with intellectual disabilities and MLTCs.

### Patient and Public Involvement

We have worked closely with people with intellectual disabilities and their carers to develop this project. We are currently training a group of people with intellectual disabilities to become research partners. Our work with these groups of people helped us understand the support they need to take part in the research. 

Continued involvement of patients and members of the public will be supported by our carer co-applicant, charity partners and Sense College, a local college supporting people with intellectual disabilities

### Dissemination

As well as research publications, our findings will be shared via social media, our charity partners, intellectual disability conferences, and national committees that contribute to guidelines.
