<h3>Background to AIM-CISC’s Project<a class="headerlink" href="#background-to-aim-cisc-s-project" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Long-term conditions are health issues which persist over years. Many people have more than one long-term condition (e.g. having both diabetes and asthma), which is usually referred to as having Multiple Long-Term Conditions, or “multimorbidity”. Multimorbidity often seriously affects how well people feel and what they are able to do.</p>
<p>However, health professionals like doctors or nurses often focus on one condition at a time. This can make it hard to ensure that care is properly joined-up and coordinated for people with Multiple Long-Term Conditions. Research also tends to focus on one condition at a time. This is partly because people with Multiple Long-Term Conditions, can have very complicated mixes of different conditions and treatments.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses powerful computers to analyse and understand this kind of complex information, which is carefully gathered by the NHS and others under strict rules to keep it safe and confidential. New AI methods can help us better understand what patterns of Multiple Long-Term Conditions are common and which most affect people’s lives, and help improve the quality and safety of care.</p>

<h3>What AIM-CISC Aims to achieve<a class="headerlink" href="#what-aim-cisc-aims-to-achieve" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We propose a programme of research which will use AI methods to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Identify the most common combinations of long-term conditions that people have, and examine whether people inherit a tendency to get particular combinations of conditions from their parents. This will help us understand what causes Multiple Long-Term Conditions, and identify potential treatments.</p></li>
<li><p>Examine whether particular combinations of long-term conditions are more common in some areas or communities. This will help us understand how where people live affects their health (for example, through differences in air pollution, or in access to safe open-space to play/exercise, or in having local shops that sell affordable healthy food).</p></li>
<li><p>Develop new methods for identifying people who are likely to have unexpected health problems like falls or bleeding. This will help us to work out what changes to their treatment or care could prevent these problems. One example of a possible change is medicines review to make sure that people take the right medicines for them as an individual. Another is rapid, comprehensive assessment of people admitted to hospital to ensure that their care suits all of their needs rather than just the problem that brought them into hospital.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Our team combines expertise in AI methods with experience in delivering and researching healthcare for people with Multiple Long-Term Conditions.
We will work closely with patients and members of the public to help us focus and interpret our research, and to help us make our findings widely known.
We will also work closely with other research teams to share learning and methods, and with the NHS and government to ensure that the research turns into practical improvements in care.</p>

<h3>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Many people live with two or more ‘long-term health conditions’ which include lots of different illnesses, such as cancer, heart, and mental health problems. People living with multiple long-term conditions may progress to poor health and have a shorter life expectancy. Treating multiple health conditions is a balancing act. People are often prescribed many different medicines together (known as ‘polypharmacy’). Sometimes these medicines (and their side effects) can interact in unexpected ways, causing further problems.</p>

<h3>Aims<a class="headerlink" href="#aims" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>To better understand the relationships between multiple long-term conditions, polypharmacy, personal and social factors to optimise treatment for individual patients. We will:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Use existing health data from many sources (including from people living in East London and the North-East of England) to understand how long-term health conditions and polypharmacy change and interact over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for patterns of change in long-term conditions and polypharmacy and how these patterns relate to personal/social factors and future health outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Use knowledge of these differences to understand when best to intervene to reduce health inequalities between patient groups and to improve outcomes.</p></li>

<h3>Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#methods" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Our group has experience in using new developments in computer technology, called ‘artificial intelligence’ (AI).

AI is very good at spotting patterns in this kind of data. We will use AI to look for relationships between long-term health conditions, prescribed medicines, and personal/social factors, including measures of deprivation. In the long term, our research will lead to strategies for improved management of multiple long-term conditions including targeted review of medicines.</p>

<p>About 1 in 100 people are identified as having Intellectual Disabilities (also known as learning disability in UK). Of these, about two-thirds have two or more long-term health problems, known as Multiple Long-Term Conditions (MLTCs). Sometimes these conditions, such as diabetes and heart problems, can be delayed or prevented through lifestyle changes. For other conditions like epilepsy, better management can improve the quality of life.
We are a group of researchers, health care professionals, people with intellectual disabilities and carers. We are committed to valuing diversity and improving the lives of people with intellectual disabilities to manage and prevent MLTCs.</p>

<section id="id3">
<h3>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Multiple Long-Term Conditions is becoming more common as the population becomes older and people with long-term health conditions live longer.  Currently, people with Multiple Long-Term Conditions are treated separately for each condition and prescribed different drugs, each to treat one condition. Taking multiple medicines, or polypharmacy, increases the likelihood of serious side effects. The NHS introduced Structured Medication Reviews by GPs and pharmacists to reduce the number of people taking potentially harmful combinations of drugs.  However, there is no easy way of predicting which patients are most likely to benefit from a medication review and prioritising them. The review team is then faced with gathering and making sense of information from records held in different places and piecing the information together to see how the patient’s conditions and treatments changed over time.</p>

<h3>Design and methods<a class="headerlink" href="#design-and-methods" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>

We will develop AI tools that combine information from multiple records and guidelines and calculate risks of hospital admissions and other adverse outcomes for our three multimorbidity groups. To ensure this information is easily understandable we will develop visual summaries of patients’ journeys, showing how health conditions, treatments and risks of future adverse outcomes are changing over time. These visual summaries will be tested in general practices across northern England and improved based on feedback from clinicians and patients. Patient and public involvement Members of the public, patients, carers, and clinicians will help develop and test these tools – focusing on what matters most to people whose health and care is being considered. We will also seek public views on using AIs in healthcare to ensure our approach is acceptable.</p>

But there’s no information on the effect of one drug on a second disease. This means we are not sure which drug to prescribe in these people.
We can group such people based on their mixes of disease. Then we can study the effects of a drug on each disease mix. This should help doctors prescribe better and reduce the number of drugs patients need. That would benefit almost all people with cMM.</p>

<p>A growing number of people are living with several long-term health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, depression or dementia. We call this Multiple Long-Term Conditions, which can be shortened to MLTC or “multimorbidity”. Many things throughout a person’s life influence the chances of developing health conditions. This includes their biology (e.g. age, ethnicity), things that happen to them (e.g. infections, accidents), behaviours (e.g. smoking, diet) and broader experiences (e.g. the environment people grew up in, their education, work, income). People from more disadvantaged backgrounds and/or certain ethnicities are more likely to develop MLTC and to develop it earlier. The impact (or ‘burden’) of MLTC, and the order that people develop conditions, also varies. We don’t know what all the possible opportunities are to prevent burdensome MLTC.</p>

<h3>Background to the CoMPuTE project<a class="headerlink" href="#background-to-the-compute-project" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>More than a quarter of adults in England have more than one health condition. By 2035 this is expected to increase by 10-17%. Having more than one condition is called ‘multiple long-term conditions’ (MLTC). The more conditions someone has, the more disabling the effects.</p>
<p>MLTC are difficult for both patients and carers: taking more medicines (with possible problems caused by conflicting or simply too many medications); the cost and wasted time of attending too many healthcare appointments; and the day-to-day challenges of living with multiple conditions.</p>
<p>This study hopes to predict who will suffer from MLTC and how MLTC will progress over a person’s lifetime. Previous research has focused on looking at causes of MLTC, however much is still unknown about why certain conditions appear together, how they relate to normal ageing, prevention, and appropriate care. Also, although the NHS currently invests significant amounts of money in trying to prevent specific health conditions (e.g. heart disease, cancer), many people do not engage. This is a missed opportunity to prevent future ill health.</p>

<h3>The CoMPuTE Research Aims<a class="headerlink" href="#the-compute-research-aims" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This project looks at whether using artificial intelligence (AI) can help us predict those more likely to develop MLTC – to get help sooner to those who need it and prevent people from developing MLTC in the first place.</p>
<p>Regular computer models are already used for research on electronic health records. We want to use AI techniques to process this information faster and more accurately. The data will be ‘anonymised’ so it cannot be traced to individuals. Because many people have concerns about how their data are used, members of the public have been involved in this work from the beginning and will be involved throughout. A public member leads one section of work. Other public members work on an equal level with the academic researchers.</p>

<li><p>It will investigate inequalities and the health and financial burden of MLTC.</p></li>
<li><p>It brings in the public perspective on ethical and social questions about the use of AI in healthcare. Members of often-excluded communities will be actively involved in discussion groups, the development of study materials and the writing of papers. This is important to ensure that plans to help people with MLTC address everyone’s health and care needs.</p></li>
